# Omarchy Hub System Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of how content is added to the Omarchy Hub website, including the data structure, image handling, and contribution workflow.

## Content Management System

### Data Structure

The website uses a simple JSON-based content management system with the following files:

- `data/setups.json` - User workstation configurations
- `data/themes.json` - Color schemes and visual themes
- `data/resources.json` - Documentation, guides, and tutorials
- `data/links.json` - Curated Omarchy-related links

### Content Types

#### 1. Setups
**Purpose**: Showcase user workstation configurations and hardware setups

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "name": "Setup Name",
  "description": "Setup description",
  "screenshot": "setups/setup-image.jpg",
  "link": "https://social-post-url.com",
  "device": "Hardware details",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
}
```

**Image Handling**:
- Images stored locally in `/public/setups/`
- Referenced as `setups/filename.jpg` in JSON
- Next.js Image component handles optimization
- Aspect ratio: 4:3 for setup screenshots

#### 2. Themes
**Purpose**: Display available color schemes and visual themes

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "name": "Theme Name",
  "category": "Dark Theme",
  "link": "https://github.com/username/theme",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "screenshot": "https://screenshot-url.com",
  "tags": ["official", "popular"]
}
```

**Image Handling**:
- Screenshots hosted externally (GitHub raw URLs, CDNs)
- Referenced as full URLs in JSON
- Fixed height: 192px (h-48)
- Shows theme in action (desktop, terminal, etc.)

#### 3. Resources
**Purpose**: Curate helpful documentation, guides, and learning materials

**Data Structure**:
```json

  "category": "Documentation",
  "link": "https://resource-url.com",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "tags": ["guide", "tutorial"]
}
```

**Image Handling**:

- Category badges for visual organization

#### 4. Links
**Purpose**: Quick access to official Omarchy resources

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "name": "Link Name",

}
```

**Image Handling**:
- No images (simple link cards)
- Globe icon for visual consistency

## Page Structure

### Homepage (`app/page.tsx`)

- Theme submission template
- Resource submission template
- Link submission template
- General issue template

#### 2. Pull Requests (Developer-Friendly)
- Direct JSON file editing
- Automated review process
- Pull request template for consistency

## Technical Implementation
